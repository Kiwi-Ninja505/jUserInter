# jUserInter
First attempt at Interface
I run into an error during initialization of boot layer:
java.lang.module.FindException: Error reading module: C:\Users\-----\workspace\UserInterfaceT\jUserInter\target\classes
Caused by: java.lang.module.InvalidModuleDescriptorException: wbLaunchApp.class found in top-level directory (unnamed package not allowed in module)
I don't have enough experience to have dealt with this problem. Starting another project didn't help. I used to be able to run the example file 
provided but now I run into the same issue
